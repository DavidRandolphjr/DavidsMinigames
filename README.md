# DavidsMinigames
This is very much still a work in progress. My goal is to create website where I can upload simple board games using the Python/Django Framework where 
users can play against ai and or their friends.
If users would like to play these games, they must create an account and create a lobby for other players to join. This can be done simply by clicking
on the game's icon at the home page. At the moment, only the checkers game is fully functional, while I am about half way through implementing Monopoly.
